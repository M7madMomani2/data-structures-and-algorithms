# Reverse an Array

Reverse a list implemented to shift item the first item will be the final item etc...
let's assume we have this list [1,2,3,4,5,6]
it will be [6,5,4,3,2,1]

## Challenge
> The problem that we have a list and for some reasons we need to Reverse the items without using the pre-build Reverse function

## Approach & Efficiency
I chose to use pop() fun it removes the final item in the array and returns it so I use pop and saved the returned value in the new array until the original array end
