# Array Shift
inserting a value to meddle of the list using Array Shift function

## Challenge
> The problem that we have a list and we need to add value to middle of the list


## Approach & Efficiency
> I chose to use .ceil in the first solution but I solve it in another way using list property
it adds the item to the length of the array //2 and if the length odd I add 1 to length to touch the requirement
