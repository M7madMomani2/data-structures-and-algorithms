> The problem that we need to create function to sort array using insertion sort

## Edge Cases
> invalid data type


## Approach & Efficiency
> create method InsertionSort that take array
> using for loop from 1 to length of the array
> inside loop define variable j with value counter  - 1 and key with value-> array [counter]
> using while loop to check element of the array and compare them with other and replace the index and decrease j by one
> replace the array [j+1] to the key
